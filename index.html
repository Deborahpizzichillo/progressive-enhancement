    <h2>The story</h2>

    

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, </p><blockquote class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote> <p>The farmer said, </p><blockquote class="farmer">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote> <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, </p><blockquote class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</blockquote> <p>The farmer again said, </p><blockquote class="farmer">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote>

    

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, </p><blockquote class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</blockquote> <p>and the farmer responded, </p><blockquote class="farmer">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote> <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, </p><blockquote class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote> <p>Again, he said, </p><blockquote class="farmer">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote>

    

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

<h2>Conclusion </h2> 
Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
